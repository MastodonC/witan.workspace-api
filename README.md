### defworkflowfn

Use this macro to define functions that represents 'nodes' in a workflow. It should also be used for 'sub-functions' as a way to preserve the essence of passing data through a workflow.

```clojure
(require '[witan.workspace-api :refer [defworkflowfn]]
         '[schema.core :as s])
   
(defworkflowfn my-function
  "This is a docstring" ;; optional
  {:witan/name          :my-namespace/function-name
   :witan/version       "1.0"
   :witan/input-schema  {:number s/Num}
   :witan/output-schema {:new-number s/Num}
   :witan/param-schema  {:multiplier s/Num} ;; optional, defaults to nil
   :witan/exported?     false}              ;; optional, defaults to false
  [inputs params]
  {:new-number (* (:number inputs) (:multiplier params))})
   
;; Use as a normal function - `params` optional if not used
(my-function {:number 4} {:multiplier 3))
=> {:number 4 :new-number 12}
```

The macro wraps a standard function to provide some extra functionality:
* It adds the metadata specified in the map (using `with-meta`).
* It controls the arguments so that the fn only receives keys that match the schema. For this reason, schemas *must* be a map.
* Whilst only providing what's specified in the _input schema_, the fn will only accept, as a return value, a map that validates against the _output schema_. Extraneous keys will be culled.
* The return value is merged with the original input map, so that it will accrete over time.
